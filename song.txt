You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon)
This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up
